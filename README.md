# BUTTON_ANIMATION

HERE IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL BE CREATING BUTTON ANIMATION. THE STEPS TO CREATE THIS PROJECT IS AS FOLLOWS :-
1) INSTALL VS CODE.
2) CREATE A FOLDER WHERE YOU WANT TO STORE THE FILES.
3) RIGHT-CLICK ON THE MOUSE AND SELECT MORE PROPERTIES AND CHOOSE OPEN VS CODE.
4) CREATE NEW FILES FOR STORING HTML FILES, CSS FILES, AND JAVASCRIPT FILES.
5) THEN CLICK ON GO LIVE ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF THE VS CODE SCREEN. (GO LIVE IS AN EXTENSION IN VS CODE WHICH IS USED TO WATCH/VIEW LIVE CHANGES MADE IN THE CODE. SO INSTALL THE EXTENSION FROM THE VS CODE LEFT-HAND SIDE PANEL.)

A NEW BROWSER WINDOW WILL BE APPEARED. YOU CAN MOVE ON THE BUTTONS TO SEE THE ANIMATION.
IT CAN BE EASILY APPLIED TO YOUR PROJECTS. ENJOY!!
